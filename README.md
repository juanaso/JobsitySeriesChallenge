# JobsitySeriesChallenge


hello! 

I present to you my aproach to this particular challenge 

The task I've choose to takle were only the mandatory ones, the user of this app will be able to scroll throught the list of series, choose one, see the details of the series and choose an episode in order to se its info.

What make this proyect special is that it was made entirely with TDD as the development prosess allong side with modern Android practices, every screen the user sees was already tested using Espresso and Mockito.

to summrize, the tecnologies I've used to this project were the following:

TDD \
Clean Architecture \
MVVM \
Esspreso (IU Test)\
Mockito (UnitTest)\
Retrofit (Network)\
Coroutines (Networks Flow)\
Hilt (Dependency Injector)\
JetpackNavigation (Navigations between Screens and State control)\
Glide (Display web Images)\
CustomViews\
Kotlin extensions \

to see it really Shine, open the proyect compile it, and them go to the JobsitySeriesChallenge/app/src/androidTest/java/com/juanasoapp/jobsityserieschallenge package, right click and click the option
"run tests"
then youll se the magics of Espresso and TDD working together in order to make an escalable and test safe app 

I Hope you had as much of a fun time reading and trying this proyect as i had making it!

-Engineer Juan Sulbaran.
